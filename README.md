# Clash of Clans Farming Bot

## 📌 Project Goals

This project is focused on developing an intelligent, image-based automation bot to farm **Coins** and **Elixir** efficiently in both the **Main Base** and **Builder Base** of Clash of Clans. The bot operates through screen detection, decision-making algorithms, and error recovery mechanisms to ensure 24/7 efficient farming with minimal detection risk.

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ **Automate Resource Farming**  
  Target Gold and Elixir farming by scanning bases and deploying troops when favorable loot is detected.

- ✅ **Support Both Bases**  
  The bot supports the **Main Village** for now.

- ✅ **Image Detection-Based Logic**  
  Uses image detection to:
  - Identify loot availability
  - Deploy troops at strategic points

- ✅ **Error Handling**  
  Detects and handles:
  - Network issues
  - Connection popups
  - App crashes or freezes
  - Unexpected interruptions (e.g., maintenance, login screen)

- ✅ **Anti-Detection Measures**  
  Implements techniques to mimic human-like interactions:
  - Randomized tap positions
  - Varying delays
  - Avoids repetitive patterns
  - Simulates idle time between attacks

- ✅ **Efficiency Optimization**  
  Currently achieving **~300 million coins in 5–6 hours**. Aim is to:
  - Improve target base detection accuracy
  - Reduce downtime between attacks
  - Enhance troop deployment strategy
  - Streamline resource collection
